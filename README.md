# password-generator-in-C-
 This program serves as a basic password generator, utilizing random ASCII values to create a password with a predefined length.
 This is one of many projects to come, my goal is to keep creating projects in C++ and, hopefully, one day create something meaningful. 
 Remember to initialize your random number generator with a seed, otherwise, you will repeatedly generate the same random number.

- "password generator.cpp" is the latest version is the password generator that complies with the NIST password standards recommendations.
